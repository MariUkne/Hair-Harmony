Welcome to Hair & Harmony website. 
The Salon where you get your own time. 
This page was created to reach out to more people who feel they want to pamper themselves. Maybe a new look with a new hairstyle or hair color, or a relaxing massage. If the user perhaps have pain during their pregnancy or just stiff muscles? I want to show that I`m here for them. They just have to take a look at the page and contact me by phone or e-mail. There is also a subscribe for offers option.

## Testing 

When I deployed the website, I tested clicking on all the links. They were supposed to take me to the respective pages or sections, which they did. The test was approved.

In the subscribe section, I tried to submit without any text in the field, which didn`t work. I also filled in the field without "@", which was also not accepted. That met my expectations.

[!CAUTION] 

There is no receiving page, so when the user inputs everything correctly and presses subscribe, they end up on a error page.   

### Validator Testing

     - **index.html:** No errors were returned when passing through validation.
